<h3>
	CODWOE: COmparing Dictionaries and WOrd Embeddings
</h3>
<p>
	The CODWOE shared task invites you to compare two types of semantic
	descriptions: dictionary glosses and word embedding representations. Are these
	two types of representation equivalent? Can we generate one from the other? To
	study this question, we propose two subtracks: a <b>definition modeling</b>
	track (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3298023.3298042">Noraset et
	al., 2017</a>), where participants have to generate glosses from
	vectors, and a <b>reverse dictionary</b> track
	(<a href="https://aclanthology.org/Q16-1002/">Hill et al., 2016</a>), where
	participants have to generate vectors from glosses.
</p>
<p>
	These two tracks display a number of interesting characteristics. Definition
	modeling is a vector-to-sequence task, the reverse dictionary task is a
	sequence-to-vector task&mdash;and you know that kind of thing gets NLP people
	swearing out loud. These tasks are also useful for explainable AI, since they
	involve converting human-readable data into machine-readable data and back.
</p>
<p>
	Dictionaries contain definitions, such as
	<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cod">Merriam
	Webster's</a>:
<p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cod" style="font-size:initial">
	<b>cod:</b> <em>any of various bottom-dwelling fishes (family Gadidae, the cod
	family) that usually occur in cold marine waters and often have barbels and
	three dorsal fins</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
	The task of definition modeling consists in using the vector representation of
	<tt>co&#8407;d</tt> to produce the associated gloss, "<em>any of various
	bottom-dwelling fishes (family Gadidae, the cod family) that usually occur in
	cold marine waters and often have barbels and three dorsal fins</em>". The
	reverse dictionary task is the mathematical inverse: reconstruct an	embedding
	<tt>co&#8407;d</tt> from the corresponding gloss.
</p>
<p>
	These two tracks display a number of interesting characteristics. These tasks
	are obviously <b>useful for explainable AI</b>, since they involve converting
	human-readable data into machine-readable data and back. They also have a
	<b>theoretical significance</b>: both glosses and word embeddings are also
	representations of meaning, and therefore involve the conversion of distinct
	non-formal semantic representations. From a practical point of view, the
	ability to infer word-embeddings from dictionary resources, or dictionaries
	from large unannotated corpora, would prove <b>a boon for many under-resourced
	languages</b>.

<p>
	The data can be retrieved from
	<a href="https://git.atilf.fr/tmickus/codwoe/-/tree/master/data">our git
	repository</a>. See the related <a href="#participate-get_data">codalab
	page</a> for more details as well.
</p>
<p>
	To help participants get started, we provide a basic architecture for both
	tracks, a submission format checker, and the scoring script. All of this is
	available in our public <a href="https://git.atilf.fr/tmickus/codwoe">git
	repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Keep in mind the we do not allow external data!</b> The point is to keep
	results linguistically significant and easily comparable. For all details on
	how we will evaluate submissions, check the relevant
	<a href="#learn_the_details-evaluation">codalab page</a>.

<h3>
	What we are fishing for with this shared task
</h3>
<p>
	Rather than focusing strictly on getting the highest scores on a benchmark, we
	encourage participants to approach this shared task as a collaborative
	research question: how should we compare two vastly different types of
	semantic representations such as dictionaries and word embeddings? What
	caveats are there? In fact, we already have a few questions we look forward to
	study at the end of this shared task:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Do all architectures yield comparable results?</b> Transformers, for
		instance, are generally hard to tune, require large amounts of data to train
		and have no default way of being primed with a vector: how will they fare on
		our two tracks?
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>What are the effects of combining different inputs?</b> Do multilingual
		models fare better than monolingual models? Does handling both tracks with
		the same model help or hinder results?
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Do contextual embeddings help to define polysemous words?</b> Most
		approaches that use contextual embeddings in downstream applications rely on
		fine-tuning. Will contextual embeddings used as features also prove helpful?
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	These are but a few questions that we are interested in&mdash;do come up with
	your own to test during this shared task! To encourage participants to adopt
	this mindset, here are a few key elements of this shared task:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		data from <b>5 languages</b> (EN, ES, FR, IT, RU) and from <b>multiple
		embedding architectures</b>, both static and contextual, all trained on
		comparable corpora
	</li>
	<li>
		a <b>richly annotated trial dataset</b>, which will be useful for the manual
		evaluation of your systems
	</li>
	<li>
		usage of external resources is <b>not allowed</b>, to ensure that all
		submissions are comparable
	</li>
	<li>
		a strong <b>focus on manual analyses</b> of a submitted model’s behavior
		during the reviewing process
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As is usual for SemEval tasks, we will release all data at the end of the
	shared task. Depending on participants’ consent, we also plan to collect the
	productions of all models and reuse them in a future evaluation campaign.
