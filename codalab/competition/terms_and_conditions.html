<H3>Terms and Conditions</H3>
<p>
	<em>Participants should generally adopt a spirit of good sportsmanship and
	avoid any unfair or otherwise unconscionable conduct. We provide the following
	terms and conditions to clearly delineate the guidelines to which the
	participants are expected to adhere. Organizers reserve the right to amend in
	any way the following terms, in which case modifications will be advertised
	through the shared task mailing list and the CodaLab forums.</em>
	<br/>
	<em>Participants may contact the organizers if any of the following terms
	raises their concern.</em>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Participation to the competition:</b> Any interested person may freely
	participate to the competition. By participating to the competition, you agree
	to the terms and conditions in their entirety, without amendment or provision.
	By participating to the competition, you understand and agree that your scores
	and submissions will be made public.
	<br/>
	Scores and submissions are understood as any direct or indirect contributions
	to this site or the shared task organizers, such as, but not limited to:
	results of automatic scoring programs; manual, qualitative and quantitative
	assessments of the data submitted; etc.
	<br/>
	Participants may create teams. Participants may not be part of more than one
	team. Teams and participants not belonging to any team must create exactly one
	account to the codalab competition. Team composition may not be changed once
	the evaluation phase starts.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Scoring of submissions:</b> Organizers are under no obligation to release
	scores. Official scores may be withheld, amended or removed if organizers
	judge the submission incomplete, erroneous, deceptive, or violating the letter
	or spirit of the competition's rules. Inclusion of a submission's scores is
	not an endorsement of a team or individual's submission, system, or science.
	<br/>
	Up to 50 submissions will be allowed during the evaluation phase. Scores will
	not be visible on the leaderboards until the evaluation phase is over.
	<br/>
	Submission files will be grouped according to the track, language, and in the
	case of the reverse dictionary track, the embedding architecture targeted; the
	last submission file per group will be understood as the team's or
	participant's definitive submission and ranked as such in the task description
	paper.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Data usage:</b> The provided data should be used responsibly and ethically.
	Do not attempt to misuse it in any way, including, but not limited to,
	reconstructing test sets, any none-scientific use of the data, or any other
	unconscionable usage of the data.
	<br/>
  During the course of the shared task, participants are <b>not allowed to use
	any external data.</b> This is to ensure that results are immediately
	comparable. Participants will be allowed to use external data once the
	evaluation phase is over for system review. All data will be released at the
	end of the evaluation phase.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Submission of system description papers:</b> Participants having made at
	least one submission during the evaluation phase will be invited to submit a
	paper describing their system. <b>As a requirement, a link to the code of
	systems being described will be made available to organizers or the public at
	large.</b> Participants submitting a system description paper will also be
	asked to review papers submitted by their peers in a single-blind process.
	<br/>
	<b>We further encourage system description papers to include a manual analysis
	of their systems results and productions.</b> The presence and quality of such
	an analysis will be assessed during the review process. The task description
	paper will also devote a significant amount of space to highlighting
	outstanding manual evaluations conducted by participants.
<p>
	<b>Collection of system productions:</b> Participants having made at least one
	submission during the evaluation phase will be invited to submit their
	systems' outputs to a dataset of system productions. The purpose of this
	collection of system productions will solely be to propose them as a shared
	task for upcoming text generation	evaluation campaigns.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Funding Acknowledgments:</b> This shared task was supported by a public
	grant overseen by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the
	"Investissements d'Avenir" program: Idex <em>Lorraine Universit√©
	d'Excellence</em> (reference: ANR-15-IDEX-0004).
